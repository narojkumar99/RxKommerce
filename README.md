# RxKommerce
E-commerce app with multiple stores using RxAndroid, Retrofit and Kotlin 1.1.4

To make the app works with your own WS, put the server address at the Constants' class constant URL and change the endpoints at the GetWaterApiService class.

And, of course, don't forget to improve the app's layout. This one was made only for study purpose.

Be happy (:
